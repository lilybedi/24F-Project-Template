# `modules` Folder
This folder is used to hold functionality that needs to be accessible to the entire application. `nav.py` is a module that supports our custom navigation bar on the left of the app along with some basic Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). It works by checking which role is logged in and depending on the role displays different navigation links.
